## 7.   Define project life cycle.
A project life cycle is a collection of project  phases that defines
•what work will be performed in each phase
•what deliverables will be produced and when
•who is involved in each phase, and
•how management will control and approve work produced  in each phase
## 8.List out the more on project phases?
1. **Early Phases of a Project Life Cycle**:
    
    - Resource needs are usually lowest.
    - The level of uncertainty (risk) is highest.
    - Project stakeholders have the greatest opportunity to influence the project.
2. **Middle Phases of a Project Life Cycle**:
    
    - The certainty of completing a project improves.
    - More resources are needed.
3. **Final Phase of a Project Life Cycle**:
    
    - Focuses on ensuring that project requirements were met.
    - The project sponsor approves the completion of the project.
4. **Project Management Reviews**:
    
    - These are also called phase exits or kill points.
    - They occur after each phase to evaluate the project’s progress, likely success, and continued compatibility with organizational goals.
5. **Importance of Passing Through Each Phase**:
    
    - A project should successfully pass through each of the project phases in order to continue on to the next.
6. **Unique Attributes and Diverse Nature of IT Projects**:
    
    - IT projects can be very diverse in terms of size, complexity, products produced, application area, and resource requirements.
    - IT project team members often have diverse backgrounds and skill sets.
    - IT projects use diverse technologies that change rapidly, requiring team members to be highly specialized.
7. **Recent Trends Affecting IT Project Management**:
    
    - Globalization, outsourcing, virtual teams, and Agile project management are trends that can influence how project phases are managed and executed.
8. **Product Life Cycles**:
    
    - Just as a project has a life cycle, so does a product.
    - IT projects help develop products and services, which also follow a life cycle process.
9. **Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**:
    
    - A framework for describing the phases involved in developing information systems.
10. **Life Cycle Models**:
    
    - Different models such as Predictive, Iterative, Incremental, Adaptive Software Development (ASD), and Hybrid life cycles are used depending on the nature of the project and the degree of change in requirements.
## 9.List out the project life cycle phases?
1.Starting the project
2.Organizing and preparing
3.Carrying out the work
4.Finishing the project
## 10.What are the types of product life cycle?
- **Predictive Life Cycle**: This life cycle determines the scope, schedule, and cost early in the process. Changes to the scope are carefully managed. This is often referred to as the waterfall model.
- **Iterative Life Cycle**: The scope is determined early, but time and cost estimates are modified as the product understanding increases. The product is developed through repeated cycles to add functionality. This is suitable for products with a high degree of change and low frequency of delivery.
- **Incremental Life Cycle**: Deliverables are produced through a series of iterations that add functionality within a set timeframe. The deliverable is not complete until the final iteration. This approach works best for products with a low degree of change and high frequency of delivery.
- **Adaptive Software Development (ASD) Life Cycle**: Stakeholders define and approve the detailed scope before each iteration, producing a usable product at the end of each iteration. This approach, also known as agile, is suitable for products with a high degree of change and high frequency of delivery.
- **Hybrid Life Cycle**: This combines different approaches based on the nature of the work. For instance, some deliverables might have a low degree of change and low frequency of delivery, while others might have a high degree of change and high frequency of delivery.
## 11.How top management can help project managers?
- **Providing Adequate Resources**: Ensuring that project managers have the necessary resources, such as budget, personnel, and equipment, to carry out the project effectively.
- **Approving Unique Project Needs in a Timely Manner**: Top management should be responsive to the unique requirements of projects and provide approvals swiftly to avoid delays.
- **Getting Cooperation from Other Parts of the Organization**: Facilitating cooperation and support from different departments and teams within the organization helps project managers overcome internal barriers.
- **Mentoring and Coaching on Leadership Issues**: Offering guidance and mentorship to project managers can help them develop their leadership skills and manage projects more effectively.
## 12.Define deliverable.
A **deliverable** is a product or service such as a technical report, a training session, a piece of hardware, or a segment of software code produced or provided as part of a project
## 13.List out the predictive life cycle models.
- **Waterfall model**: This model has well-defined linear stages of systems development and support.
- **Spiral model**: This model shows that software is developed using an iterative or spiral approach rather than a linear approach.
- **Incremental build model**: This model provides for progressive development of operational software.
- **Prototyping model**: This model is used for developing prototypes to clarify user requirements.
- **Rapid Application Development (RAD) model**: This model is used to produce systems quickly without sacrificing quality​​.
## 14.List out the recent affecting IT projects management.
- **Globalization**: The increased interconnectivity and interdependence of global markets and businesses.
- **Outsourcing**: Acquiring goods or services from external sources, often from other countries (offshoring).
- **Virtual teams**: Groups of individuals who work across time and space using communication technologies.
- **Agile project management**: A set of practices focused on close collaboration between programming teams and business experts​​.
## 15.Define agile software development.
Agile software development is a methodology that prioritizes flexibility, collaboration, customer satisfaction, and rapid and continuous delivery while building software.
## 16.List out the virtual teams advantages.
1. **Increasing Competiveness and Responsiveness**: Virtual teams can operate 24/7, which enhances the ability to compete in the global market and respond quickly to customer needs or market changes.
2. **Lowering Costs**: Since many virtual workers do not require office space or support beyond their home offices, there can be significant cost savings for the organization.
3. **Providing More Expertise and Flexibility**: Team members can be sourced from around the globe, which allows for a diverse pool of expertise and the ability to work around the clock.
4. **Increasing Work/Life Balance**: Virtual teams eliminate the need for fixed office hours and commuting, which can greatly improve the work-life balance for team members.



## Explain waterfall model and Spiral model
1. **Waterfall Model**:
    - **Linear and Sequential**: The Waterfall model is a traditional approach to software development that follows a linear sequence of phases, each building upon the next in a single pass.
    - **Stages**: It typically includes stages such as requirements gathering, system design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
    - **Requirements First**: The model begins with a comprehensive requirements phase, where all project requirements are expected to be fully understood and documented before moving on to the design phase.
    - **Change Management**: Changes are difficult and costly once the project progresses to later stages because the model does not accommodate iterative refinement of requirements or design.
    - **Best Suited For**: Projects with well-understood problems, stable requirements, and where the solution can be clearly defined from the outset.
2. **Spiral Model**:
    - **Iterative and Incremental**: The Spiral model is an iterative approach that builds upon the Waterfall model by adding risk analysis and incremental development.
    - **Risk-Driven**: Each iteration of the spiral involves planning, risk assessment, engineering, and customer evaluation. The focus is on identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks before they become significant issues.
    - **Stages**: The model consists of a series of overlapping cycles, each starting with goal clarification, followed by risk assessment and reduction, engineering, and then customer and user feedback.
    - **Adaptability**: It allows for changes in requirements and design as the project progresses and as more information becomes available.
    - **Best Suited For**: Projects with high risks, complex and evolving requirements, or where the solution is not fully understood at the outset.
