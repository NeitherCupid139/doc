![[Pasted image 20240613235054.png]]
## 3.    Explain sample project portfolio approach.
1. Define the portfolio: The first step is to define the scope and boundaries of the portfolio. This includes identifying the types of projects that will be included in the portfolio, as well as the strategic objectives that the portfolio is intended to support.
2. Select projects: Once the portfolio has been defined, projects are selected based on their alignment with the portfolio's strategic objectives. Projects may be selected based on a variety of criteria, such as their potential return on investment, their strategic importance, or their resource requirements.
3. Prioritize projects: After projects have been selected, they are prioritized based on their importance and urgency. This helps to ensure that the most critical projects are executed first, and that resources are allocated appropriately.
4. Allocate resources: Once projects have been prioritized, resources are allocated to each project based on its resource requirements. This includes assigning staff, equipment, and other resources to each project.
5. Manage projects: The final step is to manage the projects within the portfolio. This includes monitoring project progress, managing risks, and making adjustments as needed to ensure that the portfolio meets its strategic objectives.
## 4.    Difference between project management and project portfolio management.
1. Focus: Project management focuses on the individual project, ensuring that it is completed on time, within budget, and meets the specified requirements. Project portfolio management, on the other hand, focuses on the overall portfolio of projects, aligning them with the organization's strategic goals and optimizing the allocation of resources.
2. Scope: Project management deals with the specific activities, tasks, and deliverables of a single project. It involves planning, executing, monitoring, and controlling the project to achieve its objectives. Project portfolio management encompasses multiple projects and considers the interdependencies and interactions between them.
3. Decision-making: In project management, decisions are made primarily at the project level, considering the specific needs and constraints of that project. In project portfolio management, decisions are made at a higher level, taking into account the strategic priorities of the organization and the potential impact on the portfolio as a whole.
4. Resource allocation: Project management involves allocating resources (such as people, time, and budget) to the individual project to ensure its successful execution. Project portfolio management involves allocating resources across the portfolio, balancing the needs of different projects and maximizing the overall value of the portfolio.
5. Risk management: Both project management and project portfolio management involve risk management, but the scope and approach may differ. Project management focuses on identifying and managing risks specific to the individual project. Project portfolio management considers risks at the portfolio level, such as the impact of one project's risks on other projects or the organization as a whole.
6. Strategic alignment: Project portfolio management emphasizes the alignment of projects with the organization's strategic objectives. It ensures that the portfolio of projects supports the organization's long-term goals and contributes to its overall success. Project management, while also considering the project's objectives, may not have the same level of strategic focus.
7. Metrics and measurement: Project management typically uses metrics such as project schedule, cost, and quality to measure the performance of the individual project. Project portfolio management uses metrics such as portfolio value, strategic alignment, and resource utilization to evaluate the performance of the portfolio.
8. Stakeholders: Project management primarily involves interacting with the project team, sponsors, and other stakeholders directly related to the project. Project portfolio management involves engaging with a broader range of stakeholders, including senior management, portfolio managers, and other decision-makers.
