## 4)   What are the methods for financial analysis of project?
●Three primary methods for determining the projected financial value of projects:
○Net present value (NPV) analysis
○Return on investment (ROI)
○Payback analysis
## 5)   What is NPV? Write the formula for NPV.

●The formula for the discount factor is $1/(1+r)^t$
## 6)   Define ROI? Write the formula for ROI.
•ROI is a ratio between the net benefits and the net cost of an investment.•is calculated by subtracting the project costs from the benefits and then dividing by the costs
•ROI = (total discounted benefits - total discounted costs) / discounted costs
## 7)   What is payback period? Write the formula for PP?
•The payback period is the amount of time it will take to recoup, in the form of net cash inflows, the total dollars invested in a project
•The payback period refers to the amount of time it takes to recover the cost of an investment.
•PP = I / C
•PP is the payback period in years,
•I is the total sum you invested, and
•C is the annual cash inflow - the money you earn.
